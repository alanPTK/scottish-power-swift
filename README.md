Scottish Power Tech Test

The application is composed of two screens, one of for showing the list 
of rock tracks returned from the iTunes API and the other one 
for showing the details of the selected track on the list.

I choose the MVP (Model View Presenter) design pattern because of it's simplicity, modularity and the possibilities to doing 
unit testing that are not always possible using the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern.
